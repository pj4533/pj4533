# Hi, I'm PJ  [![Pronouns](https://img.shields.io/badge/pronouns-he%2Fhim-blueviolet)](https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why)

Outside of my [day job](https://www.evertrue.com), lately I have been working on a side project called [App Of Mapping](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-of-mapping/id1463860309). It is an iOS app for creating random dungeons for D&D 5e, with an old school visual aethestic.

The most recent open source work I did was a bunch of poker related apps, you can find them below, but I havn't worked on them recently.
